# oidc-drasil
Third attempt at implementing fake mojang services. This time somewhat successful.

Compatible with authlib-inject (and coincidentally PollyMC).  
Contrary to the name it mostly uses OAuth2, oidc part lies in profile scope.  
All coding and testing was done with [authentik](https://goauthentik.io) in mind.
